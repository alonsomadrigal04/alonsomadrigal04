### Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  

🎮 I’m a 3rd-year student at [Universitat Jaume I (UJI)](https://www.uji.es), studying **Design and Development of Video Games**. I’m passionate about programming games and love working with tools like **Unity** and **Godot**.  

✨ Currently, I’m exploring the fascinating world of **shaders** and diving deeper into advanced rendering techniques.
